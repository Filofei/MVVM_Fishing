# MVVM_Fishing
Sample 2D Fishing game. Used: MVVM, RxSwift, Realm, Lottie, Bond.

This game won't be released, thus it has simple UI design and (sometimes) unoptimal UX. 
I mainly use it for practicing new skills, developing personal code style and testing MVVM architecture.
However it is functional and bug-free, so you can clone it and run on your computer.
